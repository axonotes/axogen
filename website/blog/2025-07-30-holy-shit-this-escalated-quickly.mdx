    Holy Shit, This Escalated Quickly - Axogen v0.5.0 Is Here And I Can't Even
authors: [oliverseifert]

Originally I wanted to write this article at the end of the week, but it just
happened too much in the meantime.

Since my last article about 1.5 weeks went past. I was on holidays for 5 days so
not much progress then, but in the other time we got this shit that made me
realize: maybe I actually built something people want?

**TL;DR: My .env rant got featured in DEV's Top 7, I got so hyped I locked
myself in my house for 4 days straight and shipped secret detection, 10+ file
formats, nested commands, backup systems, and proper type safety. We're at
v0.5.0 now and honestly I can't believe this is working.**

## Wait, Dev.to Featured Me in Their Top 7?!

So first things first - I GOT PROMOTED ON THE DEV.TO WEEKLY TOP 7. Like how
freaking crazy is that!!!!!

[Top 7 Featured DEV Posts of the Week](https://dev.to/devteam/top-7-featured-dev-posts-of-the-week-1490)

This happened 2 days ago and I'm still processing it. My little config tool rant
sitting next to articles with thousands of views. We're at about 400 reads total
now - not massive, but people are reading about my .env file frustrations and
thinking "yeah, this guy gets it."

While my article was doing its thing, I was so nervous that I couldn't stop
myself from coding. I haven't left my house in 4 days... So I did what any
reasonable developer would do: I went completely overboard with new features and
improvements.

## The Type Safety Revolution (Finally!)

Remember how the old API was kinda... loose? Yeah, I fixed that.

The new recommended way uses dedicated functions for each target type, and
TypeScript now actually knows what you're doing:

```typescript
import {defineConfig, env, json} from "@axonotes/axogen";

export default defineConfig({
    targets: {
        someService: json({
            path: "output/someService.json",
            variables: {
                name: "MyService",
                version: "1.3.0",
            },
        }),
        myEnvironment: env({
            path: "output/.env",
            variables: {
                PRODUCTION: "true",
                API_KEY: "12345",
                DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb",
            },
        }),
    },
});
```

You still can use the old structure, but now you get proper IntelliSense for
each target type.

## Secret Detection That Prevents Disasters

Here's something that kept me up at night: what if someone accidentally pushes
their production API keys because Axogen generated them into a non-gitignored
file?

So I built secret detection. Before generation of each target, all variables are
scanned. If they look like secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) and the
target file is NOT gitignored, Axogen refuses to generate.

![Secret Detection Example](/blog/2025-07-30-1.png)

> Also, did you notice 😏, this time I used a screenshot to show off the colored
> output? I know, I know, I'm a rebel.

But sometimes you actually want to generate "secrets" - like development
database URLs or test API keys. Just wrap them with `unsafe()`:

```typescript
import {defineConfig, env, unsafe} from "@axonotes/axogen";

export default defineConfig({
    targets: {
        myEnvironment: env({
            path: "output/.env",
            variables: {
                PRODUCTION: false,
                API_KEY: unsafe("your-dev-api-key-here", "Development mode"),
            },
        }),
    },
});
```

The second parameter is required - you have to explicitly say WHY this is safe.
No more "oops, I pushed the prod keys" moments.

## Zod Schema Validation (Because Type Safety Everywhere)

Remember how I said this was powered by Zod but you couldn't really use Zod's
full power? Fixed that too.

Now you can validate your target configurations before generating, and
TypeScript will complain if your variables don't match your schema:

```typescript
import {defineConfig, json} from "@axonotes/axogen";
import * as z from "zod";

export default defineConfig({
    targets: {
        someService: json({
            path: "output/someService.json",
            schema: z.object({
                name: z.string().describe("The name of the service"),
                version: z.string().describe("The version of the service"),
            }),
            variables: {
                name: "MyService",
                version: 2, // TSC will error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
            },
        }),
    },
});
```

Your editor lights up with red squiggles before you even try to generate. And if
you somehow ignore TypeScript (why would you do that?), Zod catches it at
runtime with beautiful error messages.

## Backup System (I have trust-issue okay?)

You know that moment when you run a generation command and accidentally
overwrite something important? Yeah, me too.

Axogen can now create backups of your targets before overwriting them:

```typescript
import {defineConfig, json} from "@axonotes/axogen";

export default defineConfig({
    targets: {
        someService: json({
            path: "output/someService.json",
            variables: {
                name: "MyService",
                version: "1.3.0",
            },
            backup: true,
            // backupPath: "your/own/backup/path.json", // Optional
        }),
    },
});
```

Default backup location is `.axogen/backup/{{path}}`. Currently keeps one
backup - though I'm thinking about adding more sophisticated backup options with
retention policies.

## Conditional Generation

Sometimes you only want to generate certain configs under certain conditions.
Now you can:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    targets: {
        productionSecrets: env({
            path: "secrets/.env.prod",
            variables: {
                REAL_API_KEY: "super-secret-key",
                PROD_DATABASE_URL: "postgres://prod-server/db",
            },
            condition: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
        }),
    },
});
```

The `condition` is just a boolean - use it for whatever logic you want.
Environment checks, feature flags, time-based generation, whatever makes sense
for your use case.

## Command System Overhaul (Nested Commands Are Here)

The old command system was... functional. The new one is beautiful.

You can now create as many nested command groups as you want, and they're all
auto-registered with full type safety. There are actually 5 different ways to
define commands:

```typescript
import {cmd, defineConfig, group, liveExec} from "@axonotes/axogen";
import * as z from "zod";

export default defineConfig({
    commands: {
        hello: "echo 'Hello, world!'", // Simple string
        build: async (context) => {
            // Direct function
            console.log("Building...");
            await liveExec("bun run build");
        },
        dev: cmd({
            help: "Give a string command some help text",
            command: "echo 'This is a dev command'",
        }),
        echo: cmd({
            help: "A command that echoes the input",
            args: {
                input: z.string().describe("The input to echo"),
            },
            exec: (context) => {
                console.log(context.args.input);
            },
        }),
        database: group({
            help: "Database management commands",
            commands: {
                migrate: cmd({
                    help: "Run database migrations",
                    exec: (context) => console.log("Running migrations..."),
                }),
                seed: cmd({
                    help: "Seed the database with test data",
                    exec: (context) => console.log("Seeding database..."),
                }),
                backup: group({
                    help: "Database backup operations",
                    commands: {
                        create: cmd({
                            help: "Create a database backup",
                            options: {
                                name: z.string().describe("Backup name"),
                            },
                            exec: (ctx) => {
                                console.log(
                                    `Creating backup: ${ctx.options.name}`
                                );
                            },
                        }),
                    },
                }),
            },
        }),
    },
});
```

Now `axogen run database backup create --name "before-migration"` just works.
The help system is automatically generated. IntelliSense knows about all your
args and options. It's like having a professional CLI framework built into your
config tool.

## Environment Loading Revolution

The `loadEnv` function got a complete makeover. You can now configure the
loading process and select different files:

```typescript
import {loadEnv} from "@axonotes/axogen";
import * as z from "zod";

const env = loadEnv(
    z.object({
        NODE_ENV: z.enum(["development", "production"]).default("development"),
        PORT: z.coerce.number().default(3000),
        DATABASE_URL: z.url().describe("The URL of the database"),
    }),
    {
        path: ".env.custom",
        // Any dotenvx options work here
        verbose: true,
        override: true,
    }
);
```

Full dotenvx compatibility means you get all the advanced environment loading
features, but with Zod validation on top.

## Universal File Loading

But wait, there's more! Ever wanted to load TOML, YAML, or other config formats
with the same type safety?

```typescript
import {loadFile} from "@axonotes/axogen";
import * as z from "zod";

const config = loadFile(
    "myFile.toml",
    "toml",
    z.object({
        key1: z.string().describe("Description for key1"),
        key2: z.number().describe("Description for key2"),
        key3: z.boolean().describe("Description for key3"),
    })
);
```

Works with basically any config format you throw at it. Same Zod validation,
same type safety, same beautiful error messages.

## File Format Explosion

Speaking of formats, I went a bit crazy with the supported file types:

**For loading:**

- json, json5, jsonc, hjson
- yaml
- toml
- ini, properties
- env
- xml, csv, cson

**For generating:**

- All the loading formats, plus...
- template (nunjucks, handlebars, mustache)

## Performance & Code Quality (The Boring But Important Stuff)

Version 0.5.0 isn't just about features. I spent a lot of time on:

- **Better error handling**: Clearer messages, better stack traces
- **Performance improvements**: Mainly TSC cleanup - wasn't slow before, just a
  tiny bit faster now
- **Code structure**: Much cleaner internals, easier to contribute to
- **Safety improvements**: More validation, fewer edge cases

The kind of stuff you don't notice until you don't have to think about it.

## Join the Discord (Why Not?)

Oh, and I haven't mentioned this before, but we already had a Discord server for
Axonotes:

[Join the Axonotes Discord](https://discord.gg/myBMaaDeQu)

Come ask questions, complain about bugs, or just chat about config management.
People can join and ask Axogen questions there too if they want.

## What's Next?

We're at v0.5.0 now, and honestly? I'm just getting started. Some big things on
the roadmap:

- **Project initialization**: `npx @axonotes/axogen init` command
- **Secrets management**: Doppler, Vault, AWS Secrets Manager integration
- **Runtime loading**: Import your generated configs directly into your app

But right now, I'm just excited that this thing I built in frustration is
helping some people. The few GitHub stars (about 5 now), the Discord
conversations - it's all reminding me why I love building tools.

With that in mind, Axogen is still not production ready. But I'm working on it!
I still have 1.5 weeks of spare time to spend lol.

## Try The New Hotness

If you tried the old version and bounced off, give v0.5.0 a shot. If you haven't
tried it yet, now's a great time:

```bash
npm install @axonotes/axogen@latest

# Check out the updated docs for examples
# (not updated yet XD, maybe just use this article as a guide):
# https://axonotes.github.io/axogen/
```

The API is much more stable now, the type safety is useful, and the features
solve real problems instead of just being neat ideas.

Configuration management doesn't have to suck. Your environment variables can
have types. Your scripts can be intelligent. Your deployments can be consistent.

Still feels surreal, honestly.
